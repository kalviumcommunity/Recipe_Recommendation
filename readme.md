## 📌 Prompting Techniques

### 1. System & User Prompt  
Defines the role of the assistant (system) and an example user query.

### 2. Zero-Shot Prompting  
AI generates a recipe without prior examples.

### 3. One-Shot Prompting  
One example recipe prompt is provided before asking a new query.

### 4. Multi-Shot Prompting  
Multiple examples guide the AI before the user query.

### 5. Dynamic Prompting  
User-specific context (like *“I am vegetarian”*) is added dynamically.

### 6. Chain-of-Thought Prompting  
AI explains step by step how it arrives at the recipe.
