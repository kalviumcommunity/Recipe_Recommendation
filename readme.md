# 🍳 Recipe Recommendation Website

This project is an **AI-driven Recipe Suggestion Platform** created using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OpenAI GPT API**.  
It helps users discover recipe ideas based on their **available ingredients, food choices, or questions**.

The project also highlights several **prompt engineering strategies** as part of coursework, such as:

- **System & User Prompts**
- **Zero-Shot Prompting**
- **One-Shot Prompting**
- **Few-Shot / Multi-Shot Prompting**
- **Dynamic Context Prompts**
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**

## 📌 Prompting Methods

### 1. **System & User Prompt**
Defines the assistant’s role (**system**) alongside a sample user request.  

### 2. **Zero-Shot Prompting**
AI produces a recipe with no prior examples given.  

### 3. **One-Shot Prompting**
A single example is shown before asking for a new recipe.  

### 4. **Multi-Shot Prompting**
Several examples are given to guide the AI’s response.  

### 5. **Dynamic Prompting**
Context is tailored for the user (e.g., “I follow a vegetarian diet”).  

### 6. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
AI breaks down the reasoning process step by step before giving a recipe.
